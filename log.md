# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started The Odin Project's JavaScript Fundamentals 2 section that outlined different data types, starting with "strings".

**Thoughts:** Spent a good 3 hours today learning that there are various data types in JavaScript to get familiar with and I got the general idea of they work, particularly number, "string", BitInt (1234n), boolean (T/F), null, undefined, object and symbols.

Specifically about strings, concatinating strings using spaces and pluses everywhere looked tedious, but utilizing template literals with backticks and placeholders, for example ${insertVariableHere}, made it that much easier to read what I'm coding by embedding variables and expressions directly. Excited to try this.

I also got to start learning about methods in JS, such as charAt(), indexOf(), toUpperCase(), slice() and replace(), amongst others that have functionality built into JS.

### Day 1: July 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Jumped back from The Odin Project to refresh my skills with CSS, specifically using with my FCC form project.

**Thoughts:** Spent 2 hours working on my freeCodeCamp Form project, reordering divs around and focusing on the styling. After thinking about the content I wanted to use, an apartment search seemed appropriate with where life is. I worked on padding and margins of various elements as I refresh my understanding of classes and IDs, playing around with specificity and trying to understand how each component spaced around the next.

### Day 2: July 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my personal Github README to learn Markdown syntax and refresh on Git before I continue with JS conditionals.

**Thoughts:** Writing and formatting my personal README.md on Github felt very rewarding, outlining exactly what I'm working on, reusing Git and how to add in images of my toolkit as well as links to connect with me. It feels like a general base of operation to showcase where I'm at, what I'm doing and what's next.

I don't want to get too distracted from actual programming though, so continuing with JS is the main goal tomorrow.

---

### Day 3: July 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Covered a lot of ground today reading about and doing exercises with JS. I started with comparison operators (>, <, >=, ==), then logical operators (OR, AND and NOT, or ||, && and !) and ended with conditional statements (if, else if, else and switch).

**Thoughts:** After re-reading certain resources two to three times and working on their exercises, the examples shown started to click a bit. While I didn't get the same exact solution as the Calendar exercise, which used both logical operators and conditional statements, I still managed to get the calendar to work using only conditional statements and it was actually interesting to see how condensed the website's solution got. I did better on the next exercise, which involved manipulating colors with switch statements.

---

### Day 4: July 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on JavaScript exercises on Replit provided by The Odin Project via Fundamentals part 2 section.

**Thoughts:** The exercises felt like a review of what I had learned a day ago where I had to figure out how to make the provided code run. I created a free Replit account to fork the exercises to my account and got to see longer examples of how JS works before reviewing TOP's Knowledge Check questions to get more comfortable with JavaScript.

---

### Day 5: July 22th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Started learning more about browser developer tools following the Chrome DevTools Documentation by Google.

**Thoughts:** It was exciting to see the capabilities that are built into Chrome's dev tools, which opened with several ways of opening DevTools before diving into how to select and manipulate HTML and CSS directly on screen. While I was familiar with DevTools a bit already, I finished out the CSS section and was pleasantly surprised to see how much more there was to offer, particularly adding classes & pseudostates, changing box model values, seeing media queries, a nifty color picker and another way to add new style rules.

---

### Day 6: July 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Wrapped up The Odin Project's Dev Tools 2 section that included changing the DOM and debugging JavaScript, and continued with JavaScript Fundamentals part 3, which introduced functions.

**Thoughts:** Using Chrome's Dev Tools to view/edit/manipulate the DOM tree in the Elements tab as well as using the Console tab has many interesting ways to experiment with your code.

Dev Tools also have various ways to help debug your code with different tools,located in the Sources tab. While still very new to JavaScript, the largest takeaway from the section was the introduction of various breakpoints, of which there are about 7, to pause code in different ways to find your bugs. Will definitely have to revisit the details, but I did get to familiarize myself with the UI and its capabilities.

Moving on, I read a few articles on functions and how they work in JavaScript, which is definitely where I feel things will slow down as I try to grasp making functions on my own.

---

### Day 7: July 25th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Continued reading on and practicing with JavaScript functions from the TOP Fundamentals part 3 section.

**Thoughts:** Learned a bit more on how to create functions, best practices on naming functions, local & outer variables, parameters(declaring terminology) & arguments(calling terminology), and returning values. The material is definitely ramping up from HTML/CSS, but it's exciting to see the possibilities from the examples given. Under the Tasks section from the link below, my attempts were actually really close to the solutions. Will spend tomorrow reviewing the article before moving on to really absorb what I learned today.

**Links:** <br>
[Functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics) <br>

---

### Day 8: July 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reread Functions article from yesterday and continue on with reading about Function Expressions, which included a section on scope, as well as a simpler form of writing them, Arrow Functions.

**Thoughts:** I like the way arrow functions look from the examples given, but it was a bit confusing on learning both function expressions and arrow functions in the same day. Rereading about function expressions a few times, the syntax began to make more sense, but will have to revisit the readings on arrow functions to fully grasp the way the syntax changes, especially when parameters become functions. I'd mark this as one of the more challenging lessons along my web dev journey thus far, but happy to see things click more after I really reviewed the material.

[Function Expressions](https://javascript.info/function-expressions) <br>
[Arrow Functions](https://javascript.info/arrow-functions-basics)

---

### Day 9: July 27th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed the material from yesterday, on function expressions and arrow functions, before diving into the JS call stack and how it works/looks with chained function calls.

**Thoughts:** Having a day to review and really digest what I learned about function expressions and arrow functions really helped, and I'm glad I did so before moving forward. There are different ways to write your functions, shorter versus longer syntax, and in time, I'll learn which is best to use/when, but a successful day nonetheless. The exercise from yesterday, while confusing at first because I didn't realize the instructions asked to convert the function expression, NOT the expression and declaration, things clicked reading through it a second time and it actually made the exercise very simple.

I was also introduced to JavaScript's call stack for how the JavaScript engine works to execute functions (LIFO). It made sense on first read through, but will have to revisit my studies on this topic to fully understand what is happening and how to explain it.

**Links:** <br>
[JavaScript Call Stack](www.example.com) <br>

---

### Day 10: July 28th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on practice problems by The Odin Project, specifically to create 4 functions. I decided to also practice by applying arrow functions for each of the exercises.

**Thoughts:** I felt the first two functions were simple to make and then the last two, extracting last character in a string and capitalizing first letter of a string, were more challenging. I tried creating them on my own before having to review the material I studied the past few days and looking up string methods online to achieve the desired results.

---

### Day 11: July 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Read through The Odin Project's 'Problem Solving' section to learn how programmers should problem solve.

**Thoughts:** This was an excellent section that came at the right time in my learning process. Following some of the exercises, I do stare at the editor before writing a function and this section is exactly there to help with the process.

I learned about the steps one should take, Understand-Plan-Divide, where you should first understand what the problem is and gain clarity, then analyze and plan how you'll achieve the desired result by asking questions, before finally dividing up the problem into sub problems and solving them one step at a time. Big or small, this is an excellent approach to the problem solving process.

---

### Day 12: July 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned about understanding errors thrown in JavaScript and different ways to solve them.

**Thoughts:** Errors aren't as scary as they seem and we learned about three in particular, Syntax Errors, Type Errors and Reference Errors. Syntax Errors occur when the code isn't grammatically written correctly, Reference Errors occur when you're trying to reference a non existent variable within scope and Type Errors occur for different reasons. Type Errors happen when you choose an incompatible operand/argument expected by a operator or function, when you try to modify a value that can't be changed and when attempting to use a value inappropriately.

I think I'll come to understand errors more and more as they arise for me because there are some odd situations where an error might not be what one thinks. MDN has a few good examples of this.

---

### Day 13: August 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Start a Rock Paper Scissor project via The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** Started a new Git repo and began working on my first JS project, which already feels like a very humbling experience. Following the guidelines, I was able to complete each task, but there is plenty to clean up and learn about to really flesh out the application. I got stuck on incrementing score (player vs computer) as well as not counting re-do attempts when the user inputs something besides the three options. Overall, a good first start, but definitely a lot more to work on.

**Links:** <br>
[Rock Paper Scissors](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) <br>

---

### Day 14: August 2th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on my Rock Paper Scissors project, iterating on making 5 rounds work while working on keeping score.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time working on my project and fleshing out the basics of the logic before moving on to looping through 5 rounds and outputting a winner in the console. My current problem is making the scores work properly as it seems that no matter what is in the if statement (playerScore vs computerScore), the first call always wins. I plan to relook through the logic tomorrow to see what is actually going on and happening as the code runs.

---

### Day 15: August 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Rock Paper Scissors Project, shortening my code and adding a function to reset the game.

**Thoughts:** Spent some time fixing the increments on score and it works now after the game loops through 5 rounds of play, via win/lose/draw. My ultimate goal though is to figure out how to create the logic for 'First player to 5, wins', which is proving to be more difficult that initially thought. I'll have to rework the logic in a few areas in order to get things functioning properly and review scope, but it's definitely fun getting to play with my code and tweaking ideas here and there.

I also created a function to reset the scores and the game, but still thinking about where/how to use it correctly. Right now, it's after there in no input placed when asking for user input.

---

### Day 16: August 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Finished working on the console version of Rock Paper Scissors Project, adding a few additional features outside of the assignment scope.

**Thoughts:** After a long day of reworking the logic around best of 5 to first to 5, I successfully was able to make the logic work and the game operates the way I wanted it to. I also changed the end winner/loser message to alert() the user instead of announcing it in the console. Working through and testing out different approaches before getting the score to work was certainly a process, but I'm happy I got it to... function properly. Next up are a few lessons before I return to the RPS project and design a UI for it.

---

### Day 17: August 6th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Read resources and tips on how to write clean code

**Thoughts:** I felt the material I ran through today was rather straight forward because it makes sense why one should write cleaner code. Not only does it help you out when returning to a project, it helps out your team to understand how you're coding something and why you're coding something. Comments are a double edged sword and should be used sparingly in that your code should explain itself wherever possible. Sometimes, correctly naming your variables or functions will eliminate the need of a comment. With whatever it is you're coding, it's important to stay consistent because it helps with the overall readability.

We also dug into opinions on indentation, usage of semi colons, naming functions properly and handling line length, all of which will be useful to know about as I progress on my journey to create more legible code.

### Day 18: August 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned about arrays in JavaScript and how/when to use them as part of The Odin Project Fundamentals pt 4

**Thoughts:** Spent an hour learning about arrays on how to create them, use them, access them, change them, loop them as well as useful built-in properties/methods and the difference between arrays & objects (numbered indexes vs named indexes). I was wondering how to store multiple values in a single variable and we finally got here!

**Links:** <br>
[JavaScript Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp)

---

### Day 19: August 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned about various array methods and started loops as part of The Odin Project Fundamentals pt 4

**Thoughts:** There are all sorts of different ways to add or remove items to arrays:

- pop() removes the last item and returns it
- push("Bart") adds an item to the end and returns the number of items
- shift() removes the first item and returns it
- unshift("Bart") adds an item to the start of the array and returns the number of items
- toString() and join() display the array in a string
- splice(where to start, how many to delete, "items to add") adds to list
- splice() can also be used to remove via splice(where to start, how many to delete)
- slice() can take one or two arguments, one slices off everything before and two denotes slice(where to start, where to end without the end item)
- concat() can add two arrays together to form new array

---

### Day 20: August 11th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Start learning about loops in JavaScript, specifically the for loop.

**Thoughts:** Having just a bit of time today to study, I dived into the importance of loops and I already know they'll be used consistently throughout my journey. Loops help you not have to write the same code over and over again, saving you a lot of time while letting the computer do what it does best - repetitive tasks.

Loops are built up from having:
A counter (starting point of loop)
A condition (determines how long the loops runs for)
An iterator (increments through until condition is no longer true).

You can exit a loop using the break; statement. Ex. User input equals username in database and exits loop.

You can also continue through a loop, skipping through the next iteration. Ex. The loops runs through condition, only returning certain values along the way.

---

### Day 21: August 12th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Continued learning about loops in JavaScript, specifically the while and do...while loop.

**Thoughts:** Dived into while loops and do...while loops as part of the loops section of my curriculum, and it's getting fun! There were active learning exercises as part of today's lesson and I had a blast working through making my own loops. Upon completion, the solutions actually used a different version (for vs while), which allowed to me see the different ways you can use loops and how they're largely interchangeable - cool! Since I started learning with for loops, I feel more comfortable with them, but I do like the way the do...while loops look as well. Time will tell which one I end up favoring.

---

### Day 22: August 16th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed for, while and do..while loops before doing some active learning with examples.

**Thoughts:** After an adventurous weekend with family, I got back into learning about loops to help reinforce what I was studying, this time using javascript.info. First, I love this website and the way it describes the material. The examples chosen at the bottom were great and made me think a bit, particularly because of the two ways iterations were calculated and then shown. I got stuck on one of the examples, but the solution made it clear to understand. Because alert() is its own statement, in a tricky fashion, it makes sense why the examples had the same output!

I also learned about the differences in structure between loops and how they operate/execute the code in the body as well as more about inline variable declarations versus using an existing variable.

**Links:** <br>
[Loops: while and for](https://javascript.info/while-for) <br>

---

### Day 23: August 17th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Continued with active learning examples on javascript.info

**Thoughts:** Got stuck for a little while on the example that asked to write a loop that asked for a number until either the number was greater than 100 or input was cancelled. I couldn't get the input to repeatedly show up if the number was less than 100, and I used a different loop than what the solution showed.

The next example asks to output prime numbers that I think will call for the need of a nested loop, of which I'll have to review thoroughly to understand how to tackle this problem.

**Links:** <br>
[Loops: while and for](https://javascript.info/while-for) <br>

---

### Day 24: August 18th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the last exercise from javascript.info, while and for loops.

**Thoughts:** The problem is definitely tougher than expected and in the end, I needed to look at the solution for help. I understand why it works now, but labels/nested loops are a whole other thing to wrap my mind around at the moment. Without feeling stuck, I attempted the problem a few different ways before resorting to checking out the solution and I'm noticing that these things can get complex in nature, particularly looping through different for loops, but I'm determined to understand it in the long run.

**Links:** <br>
[Loops: while and for](https://javascript.info/while-for) <br>

---

### Day 25: August 19th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learn about TDD (Test Driven Development) and installed Jest using nvm before completing the first assignment.

**Thoughts:** Had some fun installing nvm, Node and Jest for some exercises that I'll be working through over the next few days/weeks. I got to use the terminal again to set things up and got to see how Jest works for testing your JavaScript code via the first exercise in the helloWorld folder.

---

### Day 26: August 20th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the second javascript exercise from The Odin Project and passed Jest tests.

**Thoughts:** The second exercise involved creating a function to repeat a string X times and getting all seven tests to pass with Jest. I had to review previous material to understand that I had to create a variable inside of the function, an empty string, to use with the addition assignment (+=) and capture the argument string, returning it X times while inside of my loop. I had fun with this one!

[Exercise 2](https://github.com/bartbzd/javascript-exercises/tree/main/02_repeatString) <br>

---

### Day 27: August 21th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the third javascript exercise from The Odin Project and passed Jest tests.

**Thoughts:** The third exercise involved creating a function to reverse a string, from single letter to multiple letters to numbers/punctuation and empty strings, and getting all seven tests to pass with Jest. I had to combine three string methods, split() to turn string into an array, reverse() to reverse the array and join() to rejoin together the reversed array back into a string. A rather simple function, but happy that I got it to work two different ways.

---

### Day 28: August 23th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the fourth javascript exercise from The Odin Project and passed first Jest test.

**Thoughts:** The fourth exercise involves creating a function to remove an argument from array, several different ways. The first of which asked to remove a single argument from the array, which I was able to pass, but it looks like the second and incoming tests are much harder from my perspective. The hint mentions looking at Array.from or spread operator, which I'll have to review tomorrow, but I can already tell the second test will prove to be much more challenging, possibly even re-working my original function that passed the first Jest test.

[Exercise 4](https://github.com/bartbzd/javascript-exercises/tree/main/04_removeFromArray) <br>

---

### Day 29: August 24th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the fourth JavaScript exercise from The Odin Project and passed all Jest tests.

**Thoughts:** The fourth exercise involved writing a function to remove an argument from array, several different ways, from a single value to multiple values, to ignoring nonpresent values, etc. This was to date, one of the hardest things I had to write and think about over and over as I was trying to wrap my head around the different moving parts. After researching indexOf() and slice(), I was able to put it together, but I do very much plan on returning to this problem in the future to review what exactly I did to ensure I absorb what I learned.

[Exercise 4](https://github.com/bartbzd/javascript-exercises/tree/main/04_removeFromArray) <br>

---

### Day 30: August 26th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on fifth JavaScript exercise from The Odin Project and passed all Jest tests.

**Thoughts:** The fifth exercise involved writing a function that takes 2 integers and returns the sum of every number betweem (and including) them. I got a handle on writing this function rather quickly and am happy with the result. It tested my knowledge of loops, function scope and writing IF statements to get my desired result. Coming from the removeFromArray exercise, I thought this was going to take me longer as they increase in difficulty, but I was able to pass all Jest tests with ease.

THe last few tests wanted me to return an ERROR if an array argument was passed as a parameter or if a string was passed in the function. Originally, I coded to check for both before stumbling on isNaN(), which let me reduce my code and check specifically for a Number value.

---

### Day 31: August 29th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on sixth JavaScript exercise from The Odin Project and passed all Jest tests.

**Thoughts:** Finished writing a function that checks to see if a year is a leap year. I wrote this one rather quickly and still was able to pass all Jest tests, which I was glad to pass so quickly. It seemed rather simpler than the previous two problems, but I was happy to exercise my skills and get working results. It tests for and works with all previous and future years, returning true or false depending on if a year is a leap year. One more exercise and we move onto DOM manipulation!

---

### Day 32: August 30th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on seventh JavaScript exercise from The Odin Project and passed all Jest tests.

**Thoughts:** Finished writing two functions that convert Celsius to Farhenheit and vice versa. After researching the formulae involved in converting both numbers, it was just a matter of putting together the functions to output the corresponding conversions. I felt like this one was simple, if not simpler, than the leap year function I wrote a day prior, but I'm glad it didn't take long.

At first, I declared variables for the conversions involved within each function, and it passed all Jest tests, but after looking at the supplied solutions, it didn't need to be there, so I reworked my return lines and incorporated the formulas directly in before rounding to the nearest tenth decimal place and outputting the conversion. It's onto DOM manipulation now and it feels like I'm finally getting into the nitty gritty.

---

### Day 33: August 31th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Learned about the basics of DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts:** Got started on the DOM manipulation lesson, learning everything from targeting nodes with selectors (including different ways to do so) to element creation to appending/removing and altering elements to understanding how events are handled, specifically reading about three different ways it's made possible.

**Links:** <br>

---

### Day 34: September 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Completed first exercise from Wes Bos's JavaScript30 program, using DOM manipulation to connect the HTML to JS for a drumkit with files provided.

Also reviewed cloning repositories and how to change their origin to be able to push my work to GitHub.

**Thoughts:** Got the chance to get my hands dirty with some DOM manipulation by following along a tutorial on how to construct a working drum kit and while it felt challenging, I was happy that I now know how functions work and I'm layering new knowledge on top of what I already learned. There are a lot of moving parts in writing the code and connecting everything together, but I'm going to rewatch the tutorial tomorrow to get a deeper understanding of how and why each piece worked as it did.

Also, up until now, I've been downloading repositories, creating a folder manually and pasting the files in before creating a git repository and linking it to the project, but figured out that I can just clone a repo locally and change the remote origin to my own repo and be able to upload my work there.

### Day 35: September 2nd, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Rewatched Wes Bos Drum kit exercise, created another branch for my Rock Paper Scissors game and began working on its UI, planning out some HTML structuring and thinking about how I'll manipulate the DOM.

**Thoughts:** After rewatching the drum kit exercise, I was tasked with creating another branch for my previous RPS game to get used to the workflow of adding in features and successfully created, named and pushed my feature repo to the remote repository on Github. I didn't have as much time as I wanted to spend on beginning my RPS UI, but I did start it and thought about what I want the general layout to look like, putting my HTML skills back to work and I will continue to do more with it tomorrow.

My general plan for this assignment will be to create the structure and styling to get things looking the way I want them to before revisiting the DOM and beginning to connect things, which might require me to go back into my code and reorganize the logic. This will be my first bigger project on my own where I use HTML, CSS and JS all together to create something I can be proud of.

### Day 36: September 3rd, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my Rock Paper Scissors UI (HTML and CSS)

**Thoughts:** Finalized the structure for my RPS UI to where I'm happy with it and began styling the initial stages. After centering everything, I added a simple background gradient that may change, but I like the color palette and want to incorporate it the best way I can. I also linked a CDN to my html page and imported icons Rock, Paper and Scissors, and placed them into my buttons, resizing the buttons and icons to satisfaction.

I got carried away a bit and wanted to continue working on the project, but I also practiced adding a SSH key on my home Windows PC and connected it to my Github before cloning my repo to the PC so that now I can work off of either my laptop or the PC. After pushing my day's work, I also updated my local laptop repo on the project, first time using the git pull command and it all worked!

### Day 37: September 4th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my Rock Paper Scissors UI (HTML and CSS)

**Thoughts:** Today I finalized my basic design for my RPS UI. I didn't want to spend too much time designing, but I reorganized some classes/IDs for geeral structing and reviewed the border-radius property to get things looking the way I wanted them to. I also imported a font of choice before removing my original gradient design, optin for 3-4 colors max.

Considering this is only my first real project (HTML/CSS/JS), I want to get back to learning DOM manipulation, so I made a few extra components to try to manipulate them on the screen, like current score for both, player and computer to really get a grasp on the concepts.

### Day 38: September 7th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Work on Rock Paper Scissors UI (HTML, CSS and JS)

**Thoughts:** I got into the nitty gritty of my project today, creating all the DOM components to link my HTML buttons and Round Display to my JavaScript, telling each button what to do, when to do it and why to do it. I had to relook at my code a few times and search online for my answers, but I got to a good stopping point tonight.

After linking the buttons to the logic, I got to adding a computer choice display, styling it and trying to get it to work, all before going a step further to show the current round winner via red/orange/green display borders. I originally opted to not have the computer selection show, but after playing the app a few times, I found it beneficial to add one.

Tomorrow, I want to add on a few more pieces as I let my creative process tinker for a bit. I don't want to be stuck on the project for too long, but there are some things I'd like to add to flesh it out.

### Day 39: September 8th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Rock Paper Scissors project and finished it!

**Thoughts:** DOM manipulation is harder than I imagined with all the moving pieces, particularly when I was trying to create the color borders around each player button selection where it feels very repeated. I couldn't get querySelectorAll or 'this' working on the button group so I made the DOM style.border changes on each button all in IF statements - will have to review those concepts more, but definitely room for improvement here I think. In general, I'm happy with my approach, basic design and pacing on this one. It'll only get more challenging from here.

### Day 40: September 9th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed fundamentals of the DOM.

**Thoughts:** Spent the day reviewing much of the concepts I learned over the last few days, some of which being DOM events, best pratices, targeting/selecting nodes and revisiting concepts on how to add/remove a class via the DOM. I want to really saturate myself in learning the DOM and manipulating it because I feel like this is where my expertise will lie in, designing nice websites that do cool things once actions are taken. Tomorrow, I dive into the additional resources provided by my curriculum on the DOM to really solidify what I've learned over this week.

### Day 41: September 10th, 2021

**Today's Progress:** Reviewed the Document Object Model (DOM)

**Thoughts:** Revisited what I've learned about the DOM, specifically how to navigate it (parent/child/sibling nodes), add nodes in different ways (appendChild/insertBefore/replaceChild) and how to find or create nodes. I want to spend a lot of time on the DOM and more tomorrow because I want to get comfortable with it, particularly handling events and writing functions on how to do so.

Tomorrow, I have a few articles on DOM even handling before reviewing TOP's Knowledge Check on the DOM and finally starting my new project, an Etch-a-Sketch. Here, we, go!
